{\Large If\ldots}\\
\\
If you can keep your head when all about you\\
are losing theirs and blaming it on you\\
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you\\
but make allowance for their doubting too\\
If you can wait, and not be tired by waiting\\
or being lied about don't deal in lies\\
or being hated, don't give way to hating,\\
and yet don't look to good, not talk too wise\\

If you can dream, but not make dreams your master\\
If you can think but not make thoughts your aim\\
If you can meet with triumph and disaster\\
and treat those two imposters just the same\\
If you can bear to hear the words you've spoken\\
twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools\\
or see the things you gave your life to broken,\\
and bend and build them up with worn out tools\\

If you can make one heap of all your winnings\\
and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss\\
and lose and start again at your beginnings\\
and never breathe a word about your loss\\
If you can force your heart and mind and sinew\\
to serve their turn long after they are gone\\
and so go on when their is nothing in you\\
except the will which says to them: 'hold on'\\

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue\\
or talk with kings nor lose the common touch\\
\emph{If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you}\\
If all men count with you, but none too much\\
If you can fill the unforgiving minute,\\
With sixty seconds worth of distance run\\
yours its the earth and everything that's in it\\
and - what is more - you'll be a man, my son.\\
