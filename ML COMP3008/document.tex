\begin{abstract}
This report assesses the uses of single- and multi-layer perceptrons to classify data and predict the secondary structure of proteins. We begin with an introduction to the problem, and the mechanics of the algorithms proposed to solve it in this report, including mention of the state-of the art in this field. The report then covers the training and evaluation of single-layer perceptrons first on sythetic datasets of increasing complexity, and then on two-set classification of actual protein data. We then go over the application of a multi-layer perceptron to the full protein secondary structure prediction problem, and discuss some of the alterations that may be made to improve prediction accuracy. Finally, the results of predictions made using these methods are compared to previous methods and those from online prediction services.
